There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  <!-- > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand. -->
  Memento

## Sub-Heading ##
  <!-- > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title. -->
  A flashcard browser extension that allows users to effectively use idle time to learn anything they want!

## Summary ##
  <!-- > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good. -->
  Memento allows users to download or create their own flashcard decks. This product is designed to maximize moments of idle time in the typical work day. These moments occur frequently throughout a typical work day whether it be before/between meetings, in the morning before you're officially 'on the clock', or whenever you feel there's 'not enough time' to do anything but maybe scroll around on your phone for a few minutes. With Memento there is always time to learn!

## Problem ##
  <!-- > Describe the problem your product solves. -->
  You just finished a meeting. You're next meeting starts in the same conference room in 7 minutes. You want to do something productive but is there anything productive you can even do in 7 minutes? Yes! With memento even a few minutes is enough time to quickly open the browser extension and improve your knowledge. It's great for quickly studying up on work information or personal interests such as learning a new language.

## Solution ##
  <!-- > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem. -->
  If there's anyone else like me in this great big world, when they are on their computer they always have a browser window open and they always have moments of idle time lasting 3-10 minutes. By integrating the product into the browser within seconds you can be in the app and learning something new or strengthening your memory of something old!

## Quote from You ##
  <!-- > A quote from a spokesperson in your company. -->
  "This app will make you want to learn." -Javi Garcia-Bengochea CEO, Founder, Great Guy in General 

## How to Get Started ##
  <!-- > Describe how easy it is to get started. -->
  It's easy! Download our app from the chrome web store log in and either download a deck provided by Quizlet or make your own! The possibilities are endless when you create your own deck. Name the deck and add pictures and text to your cards to increase the impression the card makes in your brain.

## Customer Quote ##
  <!-- > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit. -->
  "Elephants never forget and now neither do I thanks to Memento!" - Kane Tanaka, Oldest Living Person

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  <!-- > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next. -->
  Next time you think you're stuck with too much time to do nothing and too little time to do anything remeber you've always got a moment for Memento. See our quick and easy guide to getting started with your first deck at memento.com/getting-started/thisisnotarealguide.
